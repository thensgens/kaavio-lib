kaavio-lib
==========

Simple "Graph Library" for educational purposes. Common algorithms for

  - Traversing
  - Minimal Spanning Tree
  - Traveling-Salesman-Problem
  - Max-Flow
  - Minimum-Cost-Flow
  - Max-Matchings
  
are implemented (see algorithms.py for impl details).

kaavio-lib can only parse/read and use graphs in a specific format (for now).
See the "graphs" dir for working graph formats.
